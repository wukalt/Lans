## Template 🎉

**This project was not entirely created by me.**

I used the ready-made **Lezir** template.
Thanks to **Mellat Web**.


You can find the Lezir template on Mellat Web's official website [here](https://www.mellatweb.com/showpage/3566)
I divided the template into different sections and developed its backend using `C#`.
